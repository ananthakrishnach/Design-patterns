Purchase order processing is a common activity in the business sector. Each purchase order must be approved by
a management personnel at some level. For example, a project manager may approve or disapprove a purchase
order, if the manager cannot handle the purchase order for some reason, the manager forwards the purchase
order to the next higher level, and so on, until the request is handled or the approval hierarchy is exhausted.
Assume that there are three levels of approval authorities: project manager, engineering director, and vice present. They
can approve each purchase that is within ten thousand, one hundred thousand and one million dollars, and not
to exceed a total of one hundred thousand, one million and ten million dollars for the year, respectively.
